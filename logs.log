CalculateAverageExecutorServiceBatch and CalculateAverageExecutorServiceBatchProcessor are the better ones so far.

+ Waiting on CompletableFuture.allOf(..).join() or AtomicInteger does not seem to make any difference.
+ Batch size of 10_000 is better than a batch size of 100_000.
+ Increasing Xmx to 16g makes things worse.
